    "1.\tWhat is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "-\tObject-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use objects in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tWhat is a class in OOP?\n",
    "-\tThe class is a user-defined data structure that combines the methods and data members into a single entity. For the production of objects, classes serve as blueprints or code templates. You can make as many objects as you desire using a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tWhat is an object in OOP?\n",
    "-\tAn instance of a class is an object. It consists of a set of methods and attributes. Actions are carried out using a class's object. Objects have two qualities: They exhibit states and actions. (The object is equipped with properties and methods) Methods represent its behaviour, while attributes represent its state. We can alter its status by using its techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tWhat is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
    "-\tThe difference between the two can be explained as follows: Abstraction is defined as a process of hiding the implementation details of a system from the user. Thus, by using abstraction, we provided only the functionality of the system to the user. Consequently, the user will have information on what the system does, but not on how the system does it. On the other hand, encapsulation is defined as a method by which data wrapping is done into a single unit. It is used in wrapping up the data and the code acting on the data together as a single unit. Hence, in short, abstraction helps hide the unwanted details/information while encapsulation helps hide data using a single entity, or using a unit with the help of method that helps protect the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\tWhat are dunder methods in Python?\n",
    "-\tDunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, in Python are special reserved methods that are surrounded by double underscores (i.e., __method__). These methods allow you to define how instances of your classes behave when they are used with built-in Python functions or operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.\tExplain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
    "-\tInheritance in Python refers to the process of a child class receiving the parent class’s properties. The reuse of code is inheritance’s main goal. Instead of starting from scratch when developing a new class, we can use the existing class instead of re-creating it from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.\tWhat is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
    "-\tIn OOP, polymorphism refers to an object's capacity to assume several forms. Simply said, polymorphism enables us to carry out a single activity in a variety of ways. From the Greek words poly (many) and morphism (forms), we get polymorphism. Polymorphism is the capacity to assume several shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.\tHow is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
    "-\tA class's data members and methods can be made private or protected in order to achieve encapsulation. Direct access modifiers like public, private, and protected don't exist in Python, though. Single and double underscores can be used to accomplish this.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.\tWhat is a constructor in Python?\n",
    "-\tA constructor is a particular method used in object-oriented programming to generate and initialise an object of a class. In the class, this method is defined. When an object is created, the constructor is automatically run. Declaring and initialising a class's instance and data member variables is the main function of the constructor. An object's attributes are initialised by the constructor, which is a collection of statements (i.e., instructions) that run when an object is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.\tWhat are class and static methods in Python?\n",
    "-\tClass methods are methods that are bound to the class and not the instance of the class. They can access or modify the class state that applies across all instances of the class. Class methods are defined using the @classmethod decorator. Static methods are methods that belong to the class and don't access or modify the class or instance state. They are defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "11.\tWhat is method overloading in Python?\n",
    "-\tMethod overloading is defined as multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. Python does not support method overloading by default. If you define multiple methods with the same name, only the latest definition will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "12.\tWhat is method overriding in OOP?\n",
    "-\tIn Python, method overriding is the process of providing a different implementation for a method that is already defined in the superclass within a subclass. It enables the subclass to define its own version of a method with the same name and parameters as the method in the superclass. When a method is overridden, the subclass implements the method in its own way, which overrides the behaviour defined in the superclass. The subclass can then alter or expand the functionality of the inherited method.\n",
    "\n",
    "13.\tWhat is a property decorator in Python?\n",
    "-\t@property decorator is a built-in decorator in Python which is helpful in defining the properties effortlessly without manually calling the inbuilt function property(). Which is used to return the property attributes of a class from the stated getter, setter and deleter as parameters.\n",
    " \n",
    "14.\tWhy is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
    "-\tPolymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows for increased flexibility, modularity, and reusability of code. It is a powerful tool that enables developers to write more efficient, scalable, and maintainable software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "15.\tWhat is an abstract class in Python?\n",
    "-\tIn Python, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is designed to be a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes allow us to define methods that must be implemented by subclasses, ensuring a consistent interface while still allowing the subclasses to provide specific implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "16.\tWhat are the advantages of OOP?\n",
    "-\tObject-Oriented Programming (OOP) provides a more modular, reusable, and maintainable approach to software development compared to earlier programming methods and procedural programming. OOP systems can also be easily upgraded from small to large systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "17.\tWhat is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "-\tClass Variable is a variable that is declared inside a class but outside of any instance methods or init() methods is referred to as a class variable while an instance variable is a property that is joined to a class instance. In the constructor (the class's init() method), we define instance variables. Hence, this is the difference between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "18.\tWhat is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
    "-\tWhen a class is derived from more than one base class, it is called multiple Inheritance. The derived class inherits all the features of the base case.\n",
    "\n",
    "19.\tExplain the purpose of “__str__” and “__repr__” methods in Python.\n",
    "-\t“__str__”, this method is called when the str() function is used on an instance of the class. It should return a string representation of the object. “__repr__”, this method is called when the repr() function is used on an instance of the class. It should return an unambiguous string representation of the object, which can be used to recreate the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "20.\tWhat is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
    "-\tIn Python, the super() function is used to call methods from a parent (superclass) inside a child (subclass). It allows you to extend or override inherited methods while still reusing the parent’s functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "21.\tWhat is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
    "-\tThe “__del__”, method is a special method in Python that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It allows you to define specific cleanup actions that should be taken when an object is garbage collected. This method can be particularly useful for releasing external resources such as file handles, network connections, or database connections that the object may hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "22.\tWhat is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
    "-\tThe class method (@classmethod) can be used to manipulate the class and its data or to create objects of the class differently, while the static method (@staticmethod) in Python should be used when we have a function that does not have to know about the class or object.\n",
    "\n",
    "23.\tHow does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
    "-\tPolymorphism in Python, particularly in conjunction with inheritance, enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class, while still executing their specific implementations of methods. Polymorphism works by creating a relationship between classes using inheritance. When a superclass defines a method, its subclasses can override that method to provide their own implementation. At runtime, the appropriate method is called based on the actual type of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "24.\tWhat is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
    "-\tMethod chaining in Python allows us to call multiple methods on an object in a single, continuous line of code. This approach makes the code cleaner, more readable, and often easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "25.\tWhat is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
    "-\tIn Python, everything is treated as an object, including integers, strings, classes, and even functions. It provides a special method named “__call__” that allows an instance of a class (i.e. object) to behave like a function (i.e. we can call/invoke it). When we define the “__call__” method inside a class, we can call its instance (object) using parentheses, just like a regular function."
